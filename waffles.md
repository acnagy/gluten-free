# Waffles

makes about 7 [very large waffles](https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/waffle-makers/bwm640.html). Inspired by [ATK's gluten-free waffles recipe](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/11763-gluten-free-waffles)

**Dry Ingredients**

- [ ] 24 oz flour - 50/50 tapioca flour and brown rice flour
- [ ] 2 1/2 tsp xanthum gum
- [ ] 1 1/2 tsp salt
- [ ] 1 tsp baking powder

**Water**

- [ ] 3 cups of water
- [ ] 2 small lemon wedges 

**Eggs**

- [ ] 6 extra-large, or 7 large eggs
- [ ] pinch of salt

**Oil**

- [ ] 6 tbs coconut oil, soft


**Instructions**

1. Whisk together dry ingredients in a very large mixing bowl
1. Squeeze the lemon slices into the water
1. Separate eggs - reserve yolks for later, whisk whites with the pinch of salt to soft peaks
1. Turn on waffle maker to preheat
1. Stir water, coconut oil, and egg yolks into the flour - the resulting batter should be pretty runny
1. Fold in the egg whites - combine thoroughly, but avoid flattening (a few uncombined bits are ok)
1. Pour about 3/4 of a cup of batter into each waffle space - cook on the highest settings
1. Carefully remove waffles when the wafflemaker is done - they'll be easy to break. Allow to cool on a wire cooling rack for a few minutes.
