# Cinnamon Rolls
Makes 16(?) - this is a riff off of [this recipe](http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/gluten-free-cinnamon-rolls/0ca833dd-7919-4a14-90e3-f40a9648b414) + work well being made in advance and chilled before baking

# Ingredients
## Dough
 * 4 cp brown rice flour
 * 2 cp tapioca flour
 * 2 heaping tsp xanthum gum
 * 2/3 cp granulaed sugar
 * 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
 * 1 tbs salt
 * couple dashes cinnamon
 * 2 sticks butter, room temperature
 * 3 large eggs
 * 1/3 cp dark maple syrup
 * 3/4 cp whole milk
 
## Cinnamon Sugar
  * 1 cp granulated sugar
  * 2 heaping tbs cinnamon
 
## Glaze
  * 1 cp heavy cream
  * 1 1/3 cp powdered sugar
  * 1 tsp dark maple syrup
  
# Instructions
 1. Whisk together the dry ingredients for the dough. Cut in butter until thoroughly combined.
 1. Whisk together wet ingredients for the dough. Stir into the dough dry ingredients. Knead until the dough is well-combined and forms a stiff ball.
 1. Roll out the dough to 14"x16". Do one pastry turn, and roll out again.
 1. Use about 7/8 of the cinnamon sugar to cover 3/4 of the rolled out dough- starting at one long edge of the rolled out dough and fill across.
 1. Starting at the same edge as the cinnamon sugar, roll the dough into a log; cap off the empty side of the dough with a bit of cinnamon sugar before wrapping it around the outside edge of the log.
 1. Squeeze the dough log together slightly, and slice in half. Cut off the rough edges.
 1. Slice each of the dough halves into even eighths. Grease two 9" pie pans with butter.
 1. Using a thin spatula, transfer the cinnamon rolls to the baking dishes. The cinnamon sugar has a tendency to fall out the side, so transfer carefully and one-at-a-time.
 1. Dust the cinnamon rolls with the remaining cinnamon sugar.
 1. Bake for 30-40 min at 350 F. Allow to cool for ~10 min. 
 1. Combine the glaze ingredients in a clean bowl, whisk until completely mixed. Drizzle over the cinnamon rolls and serve.
